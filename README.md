# Online Outpass Application 

This project was made to digitalize the process of manual outpass filling process in hostels in NIT Hamirpur which consumes a lot of time of students and the entire process is hectic. 

Using this application, a new user should register himself on the portal. This would ensure that the genuine student is filling the application form. Then users can apply for outpass through the portal.
